# Full Stack Personal Website

1. Display personal Portfolio on the Front End from a local server database
2. User can interact with the database by add/update/delete content.
3.The buttons on the Hobbies section turns a LED light On and Off. This light is connected to a raspberry pi which host a Flask web server for this communication.  

## Frontend (HTML5,CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, React) 
Local Server on React
## Backend Server (Python, and Flask)
Local Server on Flask
## DataBase Server (SQL, SQL Server, and SQL Server Microsoft Studio). 
Local Server on SQL Server
I built a full stack website where users can interact with real-time databases through APIs. This project shows my programming and critical mindset, so that I can program robotic motors and sensors. 


Note:
Comment out code in app.py/LEDswitch.py file for testing the swithc for the raspberry pi project

comments in index.js shows the improvements/furtherments of the project
